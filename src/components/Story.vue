            I started to play drums back in 2008. My first teacher was Daniel
            Ocsovay and his son Adrian who helped me to make my first steps as a
            drummer. After a few months I've decided to join a primary music
            school in Slovakia as I'm originaly from Kalonda (SK) and we created
            with two of my friends our first band which was called Tyger. I
            started to feel that drums are becoming my passion so I moved to
            Hungary to study at the school Hang-Szín-Tér in Bodajk. After the
            first year I received the "Musician of the year" award in my school
            which motivated me a lot in the next upcoming years. In the third
            year of the school I was already invited to play a song on the album
            of the well known guitarist Mohai Tamás.

            After finishing high school I moved to Budapest, to improve my
            drumming skills and study at Bartók Béla conservatory. Moving to
            Budapest was one of my best decisions in my life as this gave me the
            opportunity to join many amazing bands.

            One of my dreams was to study in the United States as well, so in
            2018 I went to Los Angeles to join a summer program at the school
            Musicians Institute where I was able to take lessons from the best
            drum teachers in the school. This kept me going, and in 2019 I
            attended a music program in New York at the Collective school of
            music. I believe that all these decisions helped me to grow as a
            musician and be able to create my own studio as well. Curretly I'm
            working as an active session drummer and drum teacher, and I have
            already performed in the biggest festivals in Hungary like Sziget,
            EFOTT, etc., and I also had the possibility to play a concert in the
            Papp László Sport aréna. I believe that with my experience I will be
            able to help to improve my students drumming skills and introduce
            music through the drum set.
